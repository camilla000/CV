Some facts about me:

After graduating in Social Communication in SÃ£o Paulo I came to England to be a volunteer at <a href="https://www.camphilldevon.org.uk/">Camphill Devon</a> before moving to London and working in hospitality.
I am not scared of challenges or changes and look forward to starting my new career as a software developer.
